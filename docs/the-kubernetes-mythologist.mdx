## About Me
Hi, I’m **Rajesh Deshpande**, your guide through the confusing, noisy, and often misunderstood world of Kubernetes.

Every day, thousands of developers unknowingly operate with incomplete or incorrect assumptions about Kubernetes.

I’m here to change that.

---

## 🧭 Why “Mythologist”?

Because Kubernetes isn’t just a technology —  
it’s an ecosystem of:

- half-truths  
- misunderstood rules  
- legacy design decisions  
- tribal knowledge  
- outdated blogs  

Someone needed to separate facts from myths.

That became my mission.

---

## 🔥 What I Do

### ✔ Debunk Kubernetes Myths (One per day)  
Deep, technical breakdowns that go beyond “because docs say so.”

### ✔ Read Kubernetes Source Code  
Every myth is validated with real source-level evidence.

### ✔ Create Experiments You Can Reproduce  
No assumptions — only proof.

### ✔ Make Kubernetes Simple Again  
Whether you're a developer, SRE, platform engineer, or architect.

## 📚 My Experience

•	**Enabled 10x faster Kubernetes adoption** by delivering a scalable, GitOps-driven COaaS platform used to provision 500+ clusters via self-service and secure automation.

•	**Built a self-service Cloud-Native Developer Platform**, cutting development time by 80% and infra/tooling costs by 25%.

•	Standardized infra provisioning across the org via a **scalable Terraform IaC platform with 100+ reusable modules.**

•	Engineered **a Jenkins Shared Library framework that powered 2000+ pipelines,** accelerating deployment velocity and audit compliance.

•	**Built a secure image lifecycle platform for base images**, Jenkins agents, and external artifacts, enabling image signing, vulnerability scanning, and trusted Helm chart acquisition across the organization.

•	Enabled business continuity and operational resilience by helping teams **design HA, scalable, cloud-native systems with built-in disaster recovery across clouds.**

•	Developed automation tools (App Generator CLI, K8s Migration Tool, etc.) **that eliminated 40–90% of repetitive engineering tasks across projects.**

•	**Enforced Secure Software Supply Chain controls across 50+ security gates**, improving compliance and audit readiness.

•	**Built distributed observability and service mesh integration**, improving diagnostics, performance monitoring, and cross-service policy governance.

## 🧩 The Mission

To build the **world’s most authoritative myth-busting library**  
on Kubernetes and the Cloud-Native ecosystem —  
rooted in code, experiments, and real-world experience.

No noise.  
No assumptions.  
Only truth.
