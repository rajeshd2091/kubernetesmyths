## 🎯 What I Do

- I specialize in building **secure, scalable platforms** using:
  - 🐳 Kubernetes
  - 🛠️ Golang (Platform tools, Operators, GitOps automation)
  - 🔐 DevSecOps and Zero Trust implementation
  - ⚙️ Platform Engineering for developer productivity
  - Personal Projects:
    - Creator of **[KubernetesMyths.com](https://kubernetesmyths.com/)** — an open knowledge project that debunks Kubernetes myths with real-world experiments and source-code-level analysis.
    - Designed and Developed **[GoXper](https://go.techxper.in/)** - a Golang-based automation tool that scaffolds secure, production-ready microservices with CI/CD, Kubernetes, and SBOM integration — accelerating platform delivery by 10x.
