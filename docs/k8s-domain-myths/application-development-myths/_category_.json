    "description": "Most application development best practices were formed in a world of virtual machines and long-running processes.\n\n\n\nKubernetes fundamentally changes those runtime guarantees—applications can restart anytime, lose local state, and run behind multiple layers of abstraction.\nMany production issues on Kubernetes are not caused by bad code, but by assumptions that no longer hold true.\nThese application development myths highlight where traditional thinking breaks when applications are deployed on Kubernetes.\nUnderstanding these myths is essential to building resilient, cloud-native applications."
