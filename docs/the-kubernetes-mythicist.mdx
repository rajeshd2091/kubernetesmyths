## About Me
Hi, I’m **Snehal Joshi**, the Mythicist behind Kubernetes Myths.

My role is to **challenge, verify, and stress-test every myth published by the Mythologist**.

---

## 🧭 Why “Mythicist”?

Because myths don’t just need to be explained —
they need to be questioned relentlessly.

As a Mythicist, I focus on:

- Identifying hidden assumptions
- Validating edge cases
- Questioning “works in theory” explanations
- Ensuring guidance survives production reality

Every myth is reviewed with the mindset of:

  *“Would this still be true at scale, under pressure, and in real systems?”*

---

## 🔥 What I Do

### ✔ Review Technical Accuracy
Every claim is reviewed for correctness, nuance, and completeness.

### ✔ Validate Real-World Applicability
Ensures myths aren’t just technically correct, but operationally sound.

### ✔ Challenge Simplifications
Pushes back when explanations risk oversimplifying complex Kubernetes behavior.

### ✔ Improve Clarity & Precision
Refines explanations so advanced concepts remain accessible without losing depth.

---

## 📚 My Experience

- Hands-on experience with DevOps, Cloud-Native platforms, and Kubernetes-based systems
- Strong background in CI/CD, automation, platform reliability, and operational workflows
- Experience reviewing architecture decisions, failure scenarios, and production trade-offs
- Brings a practitioner’s lens to every myth

---

## 🧩 The Mission

To ensure Kubernetes Myths remains:

- Technically rigorous
- Operationally grounded
- Free from oversimplification
- Trusted by engineers working at scale

Every myth published has survived **skepticism, scrutiny, and challenge**.

it’s found by questioning every assumption.”
